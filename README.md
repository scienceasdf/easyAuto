# easyAuto

This is a mobile application for control system analysis, based on Qt. It
can draw root locus plot, calculate crossover frequency, phase margin and
gain margin. The source can be built in Android, iOS, etc.

## Prequisites
* Qt 5.7 or later( For ANdroid application, you need Qt on Android environment).
* Eigen

# TODO
* Sorting the roots of the polynomial kNUm(s)+Den(s) in a better way
* For calculating the crossover frequency, an optimized initial guess is wanted
* Add Bode plot, response plot and more analysis options
* More test cases and test codes
